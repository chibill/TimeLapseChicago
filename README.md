## Storage System.
    ### Currently the images for the frames are stored raw as .jpegs. A more suitable format will be desiered.
    
    Possible other formats
    ..* mjpeg (Store the frames in directly to the playable content.)
    ..* Custom format?
    
    ### The video is updated hourly and it is stored as a .mp4 which might not be the best format for it.
    
## Host?
    Currently this is all hosted off my personal server. Which has a HTTP server set up on it.
    Having some sort of nicer web interface would be nice.
