## Storage System.
   Currently using .jpg images file for raw images that everyday at midnight (Chicago Time) are converted to a single .mp4 video.
   This video has all the frames in order and the video is named using python's time.time().
   
   Aditionally a cat.json file holds the timestamps of each video's frames in order of there apparence in the video.
   
## Host?
   Currently this is all hosted off my personal server. Which has a HTTP server set up on it.
   Having some sort of nicer web interface would be nice.
