## Storage System.
   ### Currently the images for the frames are stored raw as .jpegs. A more suitable format will be desiered.
    
      Currently working on long term storage being MP4 files as it can compress a set of frames that are very alike by up to 70%
    
   ### The video is updated hourly and it is stored as a .mp4 which might not be the best format for it.
    
## Host?
   Currently this is all hosted off my personal server. Which has a HTTP server set up on it.
   Having some sort of nicer web interface would be nice.
